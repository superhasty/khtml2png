This is v1.0.3 of khtml2png, a command line program to create PNGs of web
pages.

Example usage:

khtml2png -display :1 --width 800 --height 1000 --scaled-width 80 --scaled-height 100 http://www.google.com/ google.png

creates an 80x100 thumbnail png of Google, scaled down from 800x1000.

If the filename you specify ends with .jpeg or .jpg, khtml2png will save 
a JPEG instead.

Cookies
*******

If the user running khtml2png hasn't been using KDE, or their cookie
policy is set to "Ask", they will be asked what to do about cookies,
causing khtml2png to hang. To avoid this, copy one of the supplied
kcookiejarrc files to ~/.kde/share/config/kcookiejarrc, or run konqueror
interactively.

X Server
********

khtml2png needs to connect to an X server (but won't create anything
on screen) - use Xvnc if using it on a server (there seem to be problems with
Xvfb). The X server needs to have enough colour depth and resolution to support
the canvas you intend to use (even though no window is opened - life is
strange). Example command line:

vncserver -depth 32 -geometry 1000x1000

Flash
*****

Unfortunately since the Macromedia flash plugin is not based on Qt, we need
to pop open a window in order to take a snapshot of the page. Use the 
--flash-delay command line option to switch this mode on. The --flash-delay
option takes an argument of the number of seconds to wait *after* the page
has loaded before taking the snapshot - you may want to use this to allow
the movie to start playing. Or you can use --flash-delay 0 to snapshot
immediately.

Obviously flash will only work if you have the plugin installed and working
with Konqueror.

KDE 3.2
*******

Unfortunately (again), khtml2png will not render form elements when compiled
against KDE 3.2 unless you use the --flash-delay option. I'm looking into it.

Bugs:

* only outputs PNGs
* requires an X server
* probably others - this was a quick hack.
